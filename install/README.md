# Requeriments:

## Operative system
- Ubuntu OS x86-64 (tested only in Bionic 18.04)
- Internet access

## Configuration assumptions
The installation scripts assume:
### a. PostgreSQL is already installed with peer authentication enabled. 
So, the following line in *pg_hba.conf* is present and uncommented:

    local	all      all          peer

Alternatively, the following line in *pg_hba.conf* should be present present and uncommented replacing POSTGRES_USER by the value of the *POSTGRES_USER* variable in `config.sh`. Default *rdkit-test*:

    local	all      POSTGRES_USER          peer

These pg_hba.conf settings are only needed for installing and testing installation.

PostgreSQL might require to be updated to the lastest minor version in the Ubuntu repository to match the version of the package *postgresql-server-dev-$PG_MAJOR* . Minor version updates hardly ever require to migrate the database data or configuration files.

### b. There is a PostgreSQL superuser that is also an Operative System user.
PostgreSQL superuser must be able to open a linux shell. 
By default, that user is *postgres*.

### c. You have access to *root* as a sudoer user. 
If not, follow the instructions removing `'sudo'` from the commands and run them after login in a terminal as *root*, e.g with `su root`.

### d. You must use a previously installed *conda* or install a brand new one.
If you choose not to follow the steps that begin with ***If you do not want to use a previously installed conda***, change *CONDA_INSTALL_DIR* variable in `config.sh` to the value of your environment variable *CONDA_PREFIX* after running in a terminal `conda activate base`.
You can get that value with: `echo $CONDA_PREFIX`.

In this case, a *conda* environment called *rdkit_built_dep* will be created in the *conda* installation in *$CONDA_INSTALL_DIR*. That environment contains libraries required by the RDKit Cartridge to run properly.

# Installation
To install the RDKit Cartridge:

 1. Copy the files in this folder to a local folder in your home directory.

 2. Open a new terminal and change the working directory to the folder mentioned in the previous step with the copied files.

 3. Check the variables in `config.sh` and change accordingly to your computer system. Do not forget to save the changes.

 4. Make a backup of *~/.bashrc* at the home of the user running the *step 6* (appart from the automatically created one by the scripts). (If it is root, usually is */root/.bashrc* . If the user is a sudoer, it is usually the home directory of the user and not */root*).

 5. **If you do not want to use a previously installed conda**, remove all *conda* activation and initialisation code from the *.bashrc* file mentioned in the previous step.

 6. **If you do not want to use a previously installed conda**, run in the terminal `sudo bash install_conda_rdkit_cartridge.sh`.
    **IMPORTANT:** If *install_conda_rdkit_cartridge.sh* fails, restore the *~/.bashrc* file as explained at the end of this README file before repeating this step or running again *install_conda_rdkit_cartridge.sh*.
 
 7. If you ran the command in the previous step, run 'bash' in the terminal or repeat step 2.

**CAUTION:** Next step **ERASES** the folder, subfolders and its contents or the file in the path *$RDBASE*, a variable set up in `config.sh`, */rdkit* by default.

**CAUTION:** Next step **ERASES** the folder, subfolders and its contents or the file in the path *rdkit-*${*RDKIT_VERSION*}*.tar.gz* in the current working directory. ${*RDKIT_VERSION*} is a variable set up in `config.sh`, and its value follows by default the pattern  *Release_yyyy_mm_n* , where *y*, *m* and *n* are numbers.

**CAUTION:** Next step **ERASES** the file ${*RDKIT_VERSION*}*.tar.gz* in the current working directory. ${*RDKIT_VERSION*} is a variable set up in `config.sh`, and its value follows by default the pattern  *Release_yyyy_mm_n* , where *y*, *m* and *n* are numbers.

 8. Run in the terminal `sudo bash -i install_rdkit_cartridge.sh`.

 9. Restart postgresql or reboot the machine. Repeat *step 2*.

10. Run in the terminal `sudo bash create_rdkit_extension.sh`.

# Testing installation (RECOMMENDED)

12. Run in the terminal `sudo bash -i config_test_rdkit_cartridge.sh` to prepare the testing environment to check if the cartridge has been built correctly.

13. Run in a terminal `sudo su [rdkit-test-user]` replacing `[rdkit-test-user]` by the value of the *POSTGRES_USER* variable in `config.sh`. Default *rdkit-test*.

**DANGER!!!:** **THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS WILL WRITE IN DATABASES**. THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO ONLY CREATE DATABASES CALLED *regression* AND *rdkit-test* AND DROP THEM. HOWEVER, **BACKUP OF ALL THE DATABASES** IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED BEFORE PROCEEDING.

14. Run in the terminal `bash -i test_rdkit_cartridge.sh` to start the test.

15. If a test step does not progress for more than 5 min, take a note of the name and number of the lastest step. 
    Then, try to stop the script by pressing *CONTROL+C* in the terminal. 
    If it does not respond, kill the python process from another terminal or close the terminal. 
    Repeat *step 13* and jump to *step 16*.

16. Run in the terminal `bash -i test_rdkit_cartridge.sh -I [number]` to resume the tests. `[number]` is the ID number of the test.

17. If you get an error while running test_rdkit_cartridge.sh or a test fails, your build or installation has errors. For help, send an issue with the output of `bash -i test_rdkit_cartridge.sh -VV -R [name_of_the_step_failed]`.  `[name_of_the_step_failed]` is a regular expression matching the name of the step failed.

# Restoring *~/.bashrc*
Once you have a working installation of the RDKit Cartridge if you have installed *conda*, you might want to restore and *~/.bashrc* files.
You can do this with:
```bash
mv ~/.bashrc.rdkit_cartridge_bkp ~/.bashrc
```
